# Ballot Push 

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a quick automated system of sending out ballots stored as PDFs in folders named after the competitors. 

The create_folders.py script will create directories from a spreadsheet of competitor names. The send_ballots.py will email them to those competitors when the ballots are scanned and ready to go in the folders.
